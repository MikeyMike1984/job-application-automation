GOAL: Build a resume generation pipeline that can analyze job descriptions and create tailored resumes
IMPLEMENTATION: 
- Created JobAnalyzer component for extracting requirements from job descriptions using both rule-based and LLM approaches
- Implemented ProfileMatcher to match user profiles against job requirements and calculate relevance scores
- Developed ResumeTemplate to manage template loading and formatting
- Built ResumeGenerator to create tailored resumes based on job requirements and user profiles
- Implemented document generation functionality (JSON format as placeholder for PDF/DOCX generation)

The resume generation pipeline consists of these key steps:
1. Analyze job description to extract skills, experience, education requirements
2. Match user profile against job requirements to identify relevant skills and experiences
3. Generate tailored content for each resume section (summary, skills, experience)
4. Format resume content according to template specifications
5. Save resume document and record in database
